Step 4: Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you are finished working on your project, you can deactivate the environment by simply typing:

Bash

deactivate
Your terminal prompt will return to normal. Remember to activate the environment again (source venv/bin/activate) the next time you work on the project.
